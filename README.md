In 1989, when I was still in high school, I released a video game for the TRS-80 Color Computer 3 (the Coco) named Zenix. Soon thereafter, I released a second game called the Crystal City.  This repository contains the original source code for these games along with CocoDisk, a C# application to read data from Coco .DSK files.
